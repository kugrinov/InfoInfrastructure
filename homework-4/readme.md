### Story Summary

You're going on a hike through a mysterious forest. There are rumors of magical creatures, bottomless pitfalls, and hidden treasures. No one has come back from the trail alive - will you be the first?

I chose this topic because it seemed like an easy way to make multiple story outcomes.

### Key Takeaways

Use += to add second sections onto the first without previous content disappearing

you have to use appendChild for elements created in javascript to show up on the page

to move from one function to another function, call the second function within the first

if else statements allow for multiples outcomes on a page

.onclick can link to functions in addition to confirm and prompt
