### Notes

Unordered lists in nav help screen readers

Names have to match for connected radio buttons and checkboxes, IDs are different

Classes and IDs are used to select elements in css, but you can only use an ID ONCE. Classes use periods and IDs use hashtags

Height can't be adjusted for inline elements, you need to put diplay: block to treat it like a block element

Flexboxes can have a flex-direction of rows and columns. Use jusitfy-content to align horizontally and align-content to align vertically

padding order: top, right, bottom, left

grid template is divided up into fractions (fr), pixels, or a combo

Loose vs strict checks use a different amount of characters. Strict checks look at the data type, loose checks just see the content. So a number x and string x can be true in loose but false in strict

If you combine a number and a string js will automatically convert it to a string. You can convert stringles to number with Number("") to make it behave properly

Use const when assigning objects and {}
