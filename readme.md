### Notes

Unordered lists in nav help screen readers

Names have to match for connected radio buttons and checkboxes, IDs are different

Classes and IDs are used to select elements in css, but you can only use an ID ONCE. Classes use periods and IDs use hashtags

Height can't be adjusted for inline elements, you need to put diplay: block to treat it like a block element
