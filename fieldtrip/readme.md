## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

The clothing, jewlery, and textiles in the Eiteljorg interested me the most. My idea for a project is to showcase the fashion in a runway format. There can be different themes grouped by different tribes and/or the use (ceremonial, casual, etc). Models wearing the clothes would stop at the end of the runway and pause with callouts pointing to te details of the clothing like materials, patterns, and other meaningful details.

### Core Webpages

Home page - brief history of indigenous groups that are being represented through their clothing and a link to the runway page

Runway page - page starts with a settings box where the users can customize what they see in the fashion show with options like tribe, occasion, and material once all that is selected a big button says start show which loads a screen of a runway with models walking down

Catalog page - a page with all of the available clothing and jewlery that may appear in the fashion show, this page is meant to be more informational so users can scroll through and look at pictures and lengthier text boxes about the items

Shop page - connects users with indigenous owned businesses that sell jewlery, textiles, etc to support the community

### Design Choices

Websites for inspiration: Eiteljorg Museum Website, firstnations.org, Vogue Runway image archive

Most of the websites had a white background and used yellow, oranges, and browns as accent colors so I would apply the same to this web app

There would be a nav up top on all pages with an active class showing an underline for the active page. The catalog page will use a grid as main styling and when an items is clicked a pop filling the screen qill display the info

The runway page will have a background of a stage and simulate camera movements
